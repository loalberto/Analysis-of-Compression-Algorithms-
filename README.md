# Analysis-of-Compression-Algorithms-
These three python projects compares three compression algorithms: Huffman Coding, LZW, and Run-Length.

All three compression algorithms were given a string, of size n, of random letters.

This file contains three python files and a pdf about the research made on these three algorithms. 
Huffman coding was used with a Heap implementation. LZW was created with a dictionary or Hash implementation
to store the keys and values. Run-Length uses a linear search to compress the string.
